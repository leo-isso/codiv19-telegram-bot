## Inspiration

I live in SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil, and due to the [coronavirus pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019%E2%80%9320_coronavirus_pandemic) the city's citizens were asked to #stayhome and help to flatten the infection graph curve, so the authorities and medical institutions can work with a less overloaded system, consequently saving more lifes.

Fortunately, as a software developer, I can still work from home, and I'm used to home office. I wanted to invest the time I won from not having to commute to work to improve my skills, and cultivate good habits. I also wanted to, somehow, help people to easily have access to secure information of Coronavirus stats, since in Brazil fake news spreads rapidly... Then I came up with this project.
